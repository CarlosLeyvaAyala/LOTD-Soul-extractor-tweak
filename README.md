# LOTD - Soul extractor tweak

Makes the soul extractor in the Safehouse from LOTD to run fast.

Transform ALL weapons placed in the Soul Extractor AT ONCE.\
No more clicking over and over, like a bored madman.

As a bonus, you won't be seeing in real time how soulgems are merged into better ones.\
They are output in their final forms.

# WHY???

The original script needed work, no doubt. My original Papyrus script was way better, but still slow.\
Now I'm porting it to Skyrim Platform just to make it fast and to test some ideas on how I could accelerate some slow scripts like this using Skyrim Platform.
